			<p>My primary role in my school's robotics club is being a programmer for FTC Team 542. We program with Java in the Android Studio IDE. Besides programming, I also served as the club treasurer. As such, I worked to procure funds and manage budgets for the club. To aid me in this, I wrote a program in Google Scripts that automates the process of approving and logging purchases. Currently, I am serving as the club president.<p>
			<p>In addition to these duties, I am also one of the summer camp coordinators. I design shirts, logos, and work with others to decide advertising and logistical details. I also animated Team 542's <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3xtIh1FJyQ'>2017 Promote video</a>, a PSA designed to promote STEM ideals and FIRST robotics.</p>

			<p><em>Interitus</em> was a collaboration between a friend and myself. He did the art, and I did the programming. It was made with an engine called GameMaker Studio, which uses a language very similar to JavaScript.</p>
			<p>The premise of the game is to survive for a set number of days against a horde of zombies that gets larger as the days go on. In order to surivve, the player must carefully manage his or her resources, including food, health, ammunition, and scrap metal.</p>

			<p><em>The Infi-Gen</em> is a proof-of-concept game that I programmed for my Digital Media course final. Like <em>Interitus</em>, it was also programmed using the GameMaker Studio engine.</p>
			<p>The main feature of the game is that all of its levels are procedurally-generated by the computer using the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm'>A* algorithm</a>. Hence, the game's name: infi(nite)-gen(eration). Notwithstanding being a proof-of-concept, <em>The Infi-Gen</em> is a playable dungeon-based crawler.</p>

			<p><em>Ferret and Carrot</em> was a collaboration between a friend and myself for our final project in Introductory Game Design. He programmed the game using an engine called <a href="http://www.stencyl.com/" target ="_blank">Stencyl</a> while I did the game art using Photoshop and Piskel.</p>
			<p>In this game (which is playable on the web at my <a href="https://redqafine.itch.io/ferret-and-carrot"target="_blank">itch.io page</a>), players must help Ferret and Carrot cross a variety of exotic and bizarre environments where gravity operates under strange rules.</p>
			<p>The game was nominated by a panel of Blizzard employees who judged it against other games created for that class's first semester final project. They believed it to have the most potential and voted for its interesting level and character design.</p>

			<p>This website is also a project of mine, one that I started during the summer of 2017. At the time, it had been a while since I used HTML or CSS, which were the first two programming languages I ever learned. Furthermore, I had never used Boostrap or jQuery, but I was excited at the challenge and constructed a workable version within a few days.</p>
			<p>In February of 2018, the original website was scrapped for the current version. This new one does not have a mobile-specific site, but I think it's easier to navigate and much cleaner visually. Its source code is publicly available on <a href="https://github.com/jj11d7t/jj11d7t.github.io" target=_blank>Github</a>; feel free to take a look under the hood!</p>

			<p>Whitney High School: Study Guide (WHS:SG) was an online video series created by some friends and myself to help students at our school. It was heavily inspired by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CrashCourse" target="_blank">Crash Course series</a> on YouTube. I animated the intros for both seasons one and two and hosted the biology series.</p>
			<p>It ran for approximately two years before its members decided we could no longer afford the time to do so. Nonethteless, its videos can still be found on the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSIonEY9hN9sigA60d2GQog" target="_blank">YouTube channel of the same name</a>.</p>
