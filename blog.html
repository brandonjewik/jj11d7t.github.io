						<span class="post-title">In a Time such as This</span>
						<span class="post-date">30 January, 2018</span>
					</div>
					<div><p class="post-text">
					My school recently had an incident. The following is addressed to not just my fellow students, but also my teachers, the administration, and anyone listening. 
					<br/><br/>
					In a time such as this, one cannot help but note the power of hysteria and "us vs. them" rhetoric. Admittedly, the school administration's response leaves much to be desired, and they could have handled the events that transpired today in a much better fashion than was demonstrated. But, they are human, and mistakes happen. We should not be so quick to jump to conclusions. We should not be so quick to pin blame. We should not be so quick to raise our pitchforks, ignite our torches, and call for heads. 
					<br/><br/>
					We are better than this. 
					<br/><br/>
					We are Whitney students. I believe that we are an exceptional sort, and I believe in the capacity for rationale within the student body. Yet I have seen nothing but anger across my Facebook feed this night. Do we not owe the administration the right to explain themselves? I cannot say that I am wholly disappointed with our administration, but I am so with us, the students. How could we have stooped so low as to be unable to engage in civil discourse about this? I understand that some people are attempting to have discussion, but that appears to be few and far between. The vast majority of posts I have seen are merely reiterations, if not direct copies, of each other. They contribute nothing. What do we hope to achieve by taking the words out of another's mouth and regurgitating it to our own peers? Furthermore, why have many elected to not respond to comments? Does that not shut off further discussion and perpetuate the problem? To do so is to merely search for confirmation bias and create an echo chamber. When searching for answers in a time such as this, that is most certainly not the way forward. 
					<br/><br/>
					Let us not be swift to anger. Let us not be swift to protest. Let us not be swift to raise our voices, clamor and shout, and make a ruckus. We saw how well that went only a few short months prior. We are Whitney students; we are not like mindless beasts who act on impulse and instinct. We can and should engage in rational discussion to talk about what happened and how to best move forward. That is what we, as mature and sensible students, ought to do in a time such as this.

						<span class="post-title">It's almost Winter Break!</span>
						<span class="post-date">19 December, 2017</span>
					</div>
					<div><p class="post-text">
					It's 11:12 PM, I'm tired from a ton of homework and tests and whatever else from the past week, but I finally made it to Winter Break. Apologies future me (and/or anyone else who is actually reading this) for any of the following incoherent thoughts. Also sorry for not posting in a while, now future me is going to look back and think, "Well darn! What'd I do with my life between August and December of 2017? No one knows because it's not logged in the blog!" 
					<br/><br/>
					What. 
					<br/><br/>
					So as I'm getting close to Winter Break, I want to look at the things I've done so far and what still needs to be done. Robotics is going well. We're at a 55+ point Autonomous run, just need to get Vuforia working to guarantee an 85 point Auto. As for Digital Media, things are going well - the programmers have just finished their ultra-speedy-super-fast training course of GameMaker that I prepared for them, the artists are really starting to develop their own styles, and the game itself is in a near playable state (hopefully we'll have an Alpha version ready by mid to late January that I can share on my 'Projects' page). I've got straight A's except for one B+ in AP Chemistry, man is that a difficult class. I can probably pull up soon. Maybe. I hope so, I think I really get this unit so maybe. 
					<br/><br/>
					School is exhausting. I wanna take a loooooong nap every day during Winter Break, I don't care if it messes with my sleep schedule, I just want to sleep. Oh, and I want to go see <em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</em>. Look really thrilling. Also it's hard to avoid spoilers on the Internet. They're everywhere.
					<br/><br/>
					Alright, I think that's enough for now. See you later, future me. Present me has to go back to studying and working on stuff. Or, now me could play video games. I mean, there's a math test tomorrow, but like... video games. And memes. Plenty of memes can be made with the new DDLC Dialogue Generator you (me? I'm confused) got yesterday. Whatever. Logging off.
					<br/><br/>
					Is that a thing people say? Logging off! Jason out! Hehe. I'm tired.

						<span class="post-title">Digital Media Club First Meeting</span>
						<span class="post-date">31 August, 2017</span>
					</div>
					<div><p class="post-text">
					Today was the first general meeting of the digital media club. Although not everyone showed up due to a miscommunication regarding the time of the meeting, a lot of people were present. Mostly an informational meeting, but it seemed like people are as excited as I am for this coming year. Looking forward to all the awesome games, films, and photos the club will produce this year! 
					<br/><br/>
					For next week, I'm going to host a programming workshop while a friend/mentor, Hunter Wu, is going to host a pixel animation workshop. Should be awesome. Going even further into the future, the cabinet and I need to prepare for Club Rush week. We're not quite sure what to present yet since we're a new club, but we should have something if we're going to recruit more members.

					<br/><br/>
					Also school starts soon. Hooray.

					<div><p class="post-text">
					As per programming tradition, the first post on this blog starts with the phrase, "Hello World!"
					<br/><br/>
					With the formalities out of the way, here's a post dedicated to the commencement of this website. With the addition of this post, it is a minimum viable product with content on every page. Of course, going forward, I'll still have to make changes to make the website more visually appealing, more efficient (code-wise), and optimize it for mobile platforms.
